# ðŸŽ¯ SIMPLE OAuth Fix - No Technical Skills Needed!

## The Problem
You're getting `redirect_uri_mismatch` errors because there's a small mismatch between what your app sends and what Google expects.

## ðŸš€ SUPER SIMPLE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Copy These EXACT URLs
Copy these URLs exactly (no spaces, no changes):

**For Authorized JavaScript origins:**
```
http://localhost:3000
https://localartisans-place.vercel.app
```

**For Authorized redirect URIs:**
```
http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
https://localartisans-place.vercel.app/auth/google/callback
```

### Step 2: Go to Google Cloud Console
1. Click this link: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find your OAuth Client ID: `895087918866-t9052h3pusqen11ri1eh0csqfa4bc9qe.apps.googleusercontent.com`
3. Click the pencil icon to edit

### Step 3: Replace Everything
1. **Delete ALL existing URLs** in both sections
2. **Paste the EXACT URLs** from Step 1
3. **Click "Save"**

### Step 4: Wait 10 Minutes
Just wait 10 minutes for Google to update their servers.

### Step 5: Test
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Login with Google"
3. It should work!

## ðŸŽ‰ That's It!

If it still doesn't work after 10 minutes:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try in incognito mode
3. Wait another 10 minutes
